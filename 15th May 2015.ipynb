    "* The Mirror was completed the total size of the mirror was around 150 GB.\n",
    "* To Build the Dependency graph, conda-skeleton downloads the package, tries to run setup.py and see what package is missing. I definitely need to do something smarter. BTW there have been some attempts to build dependecy graph of PyPI, [like this](https://ogirardot.wordpress.com/2013/01/05/state-of-the-pythonpypi-dependency-graph/). But the author build dependecy using the `install_requires` in `setup.py` but the problem is not that often not all dependencies are mentioned in `install_requires`, well I don't know if I can do any better. Before going with the dependency graph I'll create the download statistics.\n",
    "* I was also able to use `conda-skeleton` from my local `PyPI` mirror because I couldn't make `xmlrpc` requests to the mirror. I'll probably have to run the `PyPI` server on the mirror, there should be one available publically. "
