    "Now, the way numba works is that it creates a mapping of `signature` + `function` to a kernel operation. In the python to IR conversion step it converts `+=` to `inplace_binop(rhs=$const0.2, fn=+, lhs=x)` and here the operator is `inplace_binop` but the function is `+`, so the it basically get maped to the same kernel operator as that of binary `+`. To circumvent this problem I created a diffent maps for `+=` like things and then I when I detected `inplace_binonp` I modified `+` to `+=`. In the inplace operation I modified code to make the output variable same as the first input variable. But mutating the IR is rather crude and the reviewer asked to find some other method instead."
