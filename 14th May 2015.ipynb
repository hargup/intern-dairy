    "Our aim is to automatically create conda packages from PyPI. I wrote small independent script to utilize `conda-skeleton` and `conda-build` to automatically create conda packages, now I think I should abandon that approach and utilize the infrastructure provided by conda to complete the task, for example it already has the tools to query PyPI, access package indexes and versions etc.\n",

    "* “Theoretically” we should be able to build all the pure python packages, non pure python packages can be problem. I plan create a dependency graph of packages, which should ideally be a tree. Then we will just need to classify the leaf packages as pure python or non pure python. This way we can create a list of package we can “aim” to build automatically. This can also be important when we cannot build the package for some important dependency, then we will already build process which packages will be affected.\n"
