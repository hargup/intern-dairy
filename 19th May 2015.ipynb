The failures were 'setuptools', 'pip', 'PyYAML', 'MarkupSafe', 'Jinja2', 'certifi', 'pycrypto' and 'cffi' setuptools failed because it dependes on setuptools. Other packages like PyYAML and Jinja2 failed because of some issue due to name normalization, I'll look deeper into it. `pip` and `MarkupSafe` failed because they depended on Jinja2. `pycrypto` compiled correctly but it failed an import test. There the error is similar to the issue https://github.com/ContinuumIO/pypi-conda-builds/issues/1. Later Ilan told me that all these packages are part of conda package and I need not build them.\n",
