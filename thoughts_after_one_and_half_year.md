I'm reading this diary after almost 1.5 years because I'm preparing for
placements, some observations:

* There are many spelling/grammar mistakes but I guess that's fine.

* There are lots of broken links
    * My working repository was transferred to Continuum, so that repo broke
    * There are links to some google docs and I don't have permission to view
        them, probably I created them through the Continuum account
    * A question that I asked on StackOverflow isn't there anymore,

* Date-Month-Year format doesn't make files appear in chronological order, I'll
    use Year-Month-Date from the next time. Well things will also be partially
    right in the American format Month-Date-Year format.

* I planned to contribute to Warehouse but didn't
* I submitted a talk proposal about conda to pycon India but by the end of the
    internship I wasn't motivated enough to continue it.

* I had put the wrong date in two of the entries and had written July instead
    of June, wondering how many "wrong" things we might have learned from the
    mistakes in historical diaries.


Things I learned:

* How to convert a vague problem to a more tractable one.
    * Divide and Conquer (Classify and defeat)

* System's programming in Python
    * Subprocess, command line arguments, shell programming, xargs, screen
    * How to patch files, the diff format
    * Read various PEP's
    * xmlrpc
    * Abstract Syntax Tree and that you can manipulate it
