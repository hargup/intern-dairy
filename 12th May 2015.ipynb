    "Yesterday I wrote python script to automatically create conda recipes from PyPI and then build. But my aim is to build it for all the packages, and I expect to find some crazy senarios, where the build process can fail. Few of the know reasons are:\n",

    "* When the package is pure python, _in theory_ conda can build packages for all the dependencies, the problem is when it is not pure python, I have to figure out a way to determine if the package is pure python or not.\n",

    "* Sometimes `conda-skeleton` chooses wrong package name for the dependencies and it makes `conda-build` go into an infinite loop. I have to figure out why, `conda` chooses the wrong name. Example: Try building conda-package for [coursera](https://github.com/coursera-dl/coursera) from the recipe created by `conda-skeleton`.\n",
