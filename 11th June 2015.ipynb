    "1. Create a recipe by `conda-skeleton`, convert the recipe to keep only the necessary information, replace `$PYTHON setup.py install` with `pip install <package_name>`, get a list of dependencies from meta data.\n",
    "2. Get dependencies using the `pkg_resources` module, get other information about the package from PyPI's xmlrpc interface.\n",

    "`pipbuild` essentially uses `conda-skeleton` to get the dependencies it is likely that I'll be able to factor out that part of `skeleton` and call that function in `pipbuild`"
